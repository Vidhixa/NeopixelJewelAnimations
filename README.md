# Neopixel Jewel Project

This simple Arduino program creates an animation using an [Adafruit Neopixel Jewel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226). 
The animation starts out with a resting heartbeat, which gradually picks up speed, and finally explodes! Don't worry -- it's meant to be a happy explosion, not heartbreak! :)

Happy coding!
