This basic project explores some possible animations that one can program a [Neopixel Jewel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226) to display, using an Arduino (I used an [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno)). It was originally used in a Girls Who Code workshop, so the program is just a skeleton with exercises that students can work on. There is a branch that has a set of possible answers as well, for reference.
